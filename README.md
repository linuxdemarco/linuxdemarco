# _It all starts with an idea_! ðŸ’¡

I'm here to share and collaborate on software in the great big world of open source. I dream of a world where we can all build secure, dependable, robust--**awesome** software together!

It's a nice place to display stuff I AM working on ATM aaaand GitHub provides unlimited storage for public repositories, so it's a nice place to dump stuff I'm NOT working on ATM ;)
